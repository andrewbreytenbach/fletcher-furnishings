			<p>I started woodworking in 2015 after my wife and I did not have enough money to purchase the coffee table
				that we wanted. This all started with the phrase “I can build that” knowing I didn’t have the tools or
				skills yet to build a coffee table. After weeks of research and borrowing tools we were able to build a
				coffee table that we still have in our home and love 8 years later. This set in motion a hobby and
				passion I have pursued since.</p>
